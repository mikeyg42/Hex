# Hex_demo

HALF FINISHED PROJECT

This will eventually be a web app for people to play the board game Hex against their friends (and one day ranomd players online). Game logic will support playing the game on a variety of sized game board, and if I have the time I'll incorporate a ranking system to facilitate online random match. 

Using Go as much as possible with Go fiber and gorm, PostgreSQL, gorilla/websockets,ect.
