# Hex_demo

HALF FINISHED PROJECT

This is going to eventually be a web app that will allow to players to initiate a game of Hex, play each other, and then have the results of that game influence their ranking. 

Currently in the process of incorporating JWT middleware. Then I will need to introduce game mechanics and the ranking system based on winners and losers
